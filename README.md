# YE AULD OBLIGATORY 'hello-world' REPO
First Git repository, for amusement, introductory and posterity purposes only.

The Git repositories you find here contain some useful bootstrap development workarounds, an ajax/js/php contact form, and some other nifty UI components. Hopefully you found your way here becasue something I've assembled may assist you in completing some development task.

Almost everything you find in these repositories arose from one of my clients' requirements, requests or demands.  The rest of it is stuff I built for fun.  All of it is free to use via the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3.
